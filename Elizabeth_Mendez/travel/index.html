<h1> Dance Expeditions: Latin America</h1>
<p><center>You're going to need your dancing shoes.</p></center>

<div class="argentina">

<h3>Buenos Aires, Argentina</h3>

Argentina is the birthplace of tango, an exhilirating and very sensual dance. Performers dance in streets and most locals are more than happy to teach tourists how to dance for a song or two. Just remember to pay attention, and be ready for a suprise in stride.

<div class="brazil">
<h3>Sao Paulo, Brazil</h3>

SAMBA. You'll need to be light on your feet for this one. Think <em>Waka Waka</em> circa World Cup 2010 and shake for your life. Plus Brazil will be hosting the World Cup again this summer, so that means plenty of impromptu celebrations in the streets.

<div class="mexico">
<h3>Veracruz, Mexico</h3>

Take some time to relax by the beach to the tune of Mexican harp, <em>arpa jarocha</em>. Veracruz's most traditional and beautiful song in the region is also the eeriest. It's called La Bruja. Ask folklorico dancers to show you the steps, you might learn to dance with a candle atop your head.

<div class="venezuela">
<h3>Venezuela</h3>

Here you'll learn to dance Joropo.<strong>  To get the full experience you need to be wearing a full maxi skirt. Just trust me on that.</strong> The rhythm is meant to imitate the prancing of horses.

<div class="cuba">
<h3>Cuba</h3>

Afro-Caribbean Cuba was home to the Queen of Salsa, Celia Cruz. Salsa was a dance established in NYC, but the influence and sounds came from Cuba.

<div class="puerto">
<h3>Puerto Rico</h3>

I have one word for you: Reggaeton. Hip hop grinding in American night clubs has nothing on this type of dancing. Put your camera away, your mother won't want to see pictures of this.

</div>

<div class="colombia">
<h3>Colombia</h3>

Shakira is Colombian, and it makes sense. Music here won't sound like anything that reminds you of her, but follow the drums and soon your hips will understand where she gets it from. 

</div>
 
<div class="dominican">
<h3>Dominican Republic</h3>

Just like all the reaggaton artists come from Puerto Rico, all the great bachata singers have roots back in Dominician Republic. And just like reaggaton, bachata music will make you blush. It's less raunchy, but since your hips are so close, it's no wonder Romeo's recent hit literally translates to "Indecent Proposal."

<div class="ny">
<h3>New York</h3>

New York City is without a doubt the home of salsa. Head to the Copacabana in Times Square for a night of swishing and swirling in this legendary nightclub.

</div>

<div class="panama">
<h3>Panama</h3>

Probably one of the least known Latin American styles is the pindin of Panama. Listen to the accordian to understand how to move your hips and you'll be fine.
