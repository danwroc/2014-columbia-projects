        <h1>Green Tea (Matcha) Ice Cream Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups milk (480ml)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp green tea powder (Matcha)</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream (240ml)</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup and 2 Tbsp sugar (120g)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ice water in a large bowl that can hold a pot. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, add 1/4 cup of milk and green tea powder, and whisk well (the powder may not dissolve completely). T
            <li>Add them back to the rest of milk (1 3/4 cups) and mix.</li>
            <li>Heat the milk mixture and 1/2 cup of heavy cream at medium heat, and cook until just before boiling.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the rest of the heavy cream (1/2 cup), yolks, and sugar. </li>
            <li>Add hot milk very slowly to the egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Put egg/milk mixture back to the pot and cook at medium heat stirring constantly until thick (to check the thickness, dip a wood spoon in the egg/milk mixture, and check and see if you can scrape a clear line on the back of the spoon with a finger).</li>
            <li>Place the pot in the ice water and cool. </li>
            <li>Transfer to a container and chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator.</li>

            <li>Freeze 3 hours before serving.</li>
