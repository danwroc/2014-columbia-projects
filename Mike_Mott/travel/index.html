				<h2>John Muir: Yosemite Valley</h2>
				<img src="muir.png" alt="John Muir" style="float:right" width="250px">
				<p>After taking steamship passage from New York via Panama, John Muir arrived in San Francisco, California in <a href="http://www.muirrambleroute.com/">1868</a>. Upon arrival, Muir immediately traveled to Yosemite for a week, a place he'd only read about. Muir later served as a shepherd in Yosemite valley, climbed a number of the mountains there and hiked down old Indian trails. He designed mills, built cabins and most of all, wrote letters and stories in his journal.</p><p> He noted <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5yV7qVp6y">at first glance that</a>, "he was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower."</p>
