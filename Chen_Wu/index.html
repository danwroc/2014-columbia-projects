				<li>Final: 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 against Rafael Nadal</li>
				<li>World Ranking: No.3</li>
				<li>Number of Grand Slam: 1</li>
				<p><em><q> I never expect to play a final.  I never expect to win a Grand Slam.  And right now I just did it.  And especially the way I was playing all the tournament, it's for me a big surprise to play that well.  To beat Rafa today, even if he was injury, I think I play my best first set during the match; I was ready to play four hours or five to beat Novak in the quarter, to beat Berdych in semis.</q> --- Stanislas Wawrinka </em></p>

				<p><em><q> Of course is very easy to say I want to win another one.  But I think if you are tennis athlete, you have to know how much working have to be done for only to win the Grand Slam. So of course if I want to win another one or two, I have to go back to court hard working and also even more tough than before, otherwise no chance.</q> --- Li Na </em></p>

				<p><em><q> The first thing is not to be afraid of returning men's serve because obviously it's going really fast. Sometimes it's heavy on the racquet, so you have not to be scared, first of all.

				<p><em><q> I think we learned from the loss we had the semifinals, we were maybe a little bit too safe, especially me.  Since then we've been aggressive. Obviously, anytime you win, sometimes you get a little bit lucky, but the last few matches have been pretty convincing.  I think the first round was probably our toughest match. </q> --- Daniel Nestor </em></p>
