<h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>


<ul>
		<li>3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
		<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>1/2 cup oil</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

		<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>

</ul>




Whisk the sugars, eggs, oil, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.
Whisk the flours, baking soda, and salt in another bowl. 
Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; 
take care not to overmix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks and dried fruit.
Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. 
Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. 
Space the cookies about 2 inches apart on the pans. 
Bake until golden but still soft in the center, about 12 to 14 minutes, 
depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies.
