		<h2>How It Works (Basically):</h2>
		<p>Bitcoin is the world's first "crytocurrency," meaning that it uses crytography to control the creation and transfer of money (woah), rather than relying on central authorities (i.e. governments).  Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer network to generate transactions.  The technology uses digitally signed messages, which are sent to the network. Rather than being tied to the names of the payer and recipient, bitcoins are simply transferred from one address to another.  Then there's some stuff about "competitve confirmation" via "mining" sets of transactions that are shared to public record block chains, which I don't really get, and don't feel the need to try to explain.</p>

			<ui>August 2010-- Discovery that transactions weren't being properly verified before being included in the transaction log (block chain), which meant that a user could, potentially create an indefinite number of bitcoins, which someone did, generating "over 184 billion bitcoins in a transaction and transferring them to 2 addresses," according to Wikipedia.  The transaction was found and erased within hours, however, and the bug was fixed in the next version of Bitcoin protocol.</ui><br />
