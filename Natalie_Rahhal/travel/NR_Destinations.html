			<p>This colorful, seaside town is the perfect respite for the summer.  Nestled into the steep incline of the Amalfi Coast, this picturesque town is the kind of place you imageine spending your days wandering the streets and visiting with freindly local vendors, or basking on the rocky but beautiful beach. If you've ever daydreamed of anything like that, you won't be disappointed.  If you never have, you still won't be disappointed.  You can't go wrong with restaurants, the limoncello dessert drinks will abound, and the locals will learn your name.  Prepare to fall into a deep state of relaxation, and then even more deeply in love with this charming little city.
